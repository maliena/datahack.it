## Start hacking data!

Due to my work for the Open Knowledge Foundation in Germany and my general interest in open government data, I attended to several open data hackathons during the last months. What I noticed was that there are many young hackers, amateur programmers and programming newcomers having great ideas for nice data visualizations or civic apps, but not yet well-engineered skills in working with [open formats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format). This sometimes results in different kinds of frustration and a certain inability to complete a working prototype.

Often the problems (usually caused by a lack of experience) have a very basic nature. Common questions I stumbled upon had an easy to answer I/O background like _How to transform CSV to JSON in Python?_, _How to parse HTML using Java?_ or _How to load XML using JS?_. While experts usually won't think about such fundamental things, answering those or similar questions costs raw beginners not just an considerable amount of time, but also a lot of their nerves.

For that reason I decided to set up **datahack:it!**, my very own programming tutorial and code snippet sharing project. The main idea behind the project is to provide some kind of a getting started guide, mainly focused on handling open data formats such as JSON, XML, HTML, CSV or YAML.

Furthermore, all of the explained code snippets can also be found on [my personal Gist](https://gist.github.com/jbspeakr), where I not just share code, but also a few datasets I had to work with in the past.
